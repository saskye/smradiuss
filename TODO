WebUI:
WiSP -> User List -> Edit: Must be able to clear fields (MAC Address)
WiSP User Add -> Check if only certain fields are blank. Might want to add user without MAC Address.
wisp-user-edit.php - proper sql error handling, use 1 query to pull in all attribs and check them in a hash, nigel to then cleanup
wisp-multiuser-add: only generating two users with error - needs fix


Realm config
