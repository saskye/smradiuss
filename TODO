smradiusd:
* Eval around actual code in process_request



WebUI:
WiSP -> User List -> Edit: Must be able to clear fields (MAC Address)
WiSP User Add -> Check if only certain fields are blank. Might want to add user without MAC Address.
Remove the need for using $_SESSION, use $_POST instead and pass the data like that
Fix up multi-user-add, code is a bit fugly, use lastinsertid
wisp-user-delete.php - proper sql error handling
wisp-user-edit.php - proper sql error handling, use 1 query to pull in all attribs and check them in a hash, nigel to then cleanup


Realm config
